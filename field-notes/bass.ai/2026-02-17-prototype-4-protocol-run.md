# Field Note: Prototype 4 Protocol Run

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Project:** bass.ai
**Pipeline run:** `default-pipeline`
**Author:** codex

## Summary

Executed a full bass-agents default pipeline for a new game prototype (`game-prototype-4-src`) and persisted structured artifacts for all seven steps plus the source AgentTask. The prototype was implemented and validated (`npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`) with all checks passing.

## Project Context

- **Stack / domain:** React + TypeScript + Vite web game prototype
- **Stage:** rapid multi-prototype exploration
- **Goal for this session:** produce another prototype while explicitly applying bass-agents protocols and recording process learnings

## What Worked

- Pipeline sequencing created a clear planning-to-delivery trace in `agent-results/`.
- AgentTask/AgentResult schema structure kept decisions and handoffs concise.
- QA gate definitions translated directly into playable progression checks.
- Evaluator and planner outputs were easy to derive from build/typecheck logs.

## What Didn't

- Pipeline artifacts were manually authored instead of generated by a command/skill, which is slower and error-prone.
- No schema validator script was integrated; used ad hoc `jq` syntax checks only.
- No automatic linkage from evaluator findings to follow-up task generation.

## Agent-Specific Observations

| Agent | Observation | Action Item |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| pm | Concept framing was helpful but repetitive for similar prototype asks | Add a "prototype-mode" PM template that skips novelty ideation and focuses on delta from prior prototype |
| gameplay-expert | Mechanics spec was implementable and deterministic | Add reusable mechanic snippets (cast meter, strike window, tension loop) as shared references |
| designer | UI guidance was sufficient for fast implementation | Add a compact/mobile-first variant checklist to reduce rework |
| qa-adversary | Gate-focused test logic was high value | Add a required keyboard parity section to the QA template |
| coding-agent | Delivery was fast with clear constraints | Add an explicit artifact generation script to avoid manual JSON construction |
| evaluator | Build/typecheck checks were clear and objective | Include optional lighthouse/perf checks for browser prototypes |
| metaagent/planner | End-of-iteration closure was useful | Add automatic "next task" JSON seed generation for immediate iteration handoff |

## Follow-Up Actions

- [x] Create a `bass-agents` helper script that generates the 7 step result file skeletons from one AgentTask.
- [x] Add JSON schema validation command to CI for all `agent-results/*.json` files.
- [x] Add a "prototype delta" mode in PM/Game/Designer agents to avoid repeated baseline outputs.
- [x] Add evaluator extension for optional performance budget checks.
